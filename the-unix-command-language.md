INTRODUCTION
------------

A program is generally exponentially complicated by the number of
notions that it invents for itself. To reduce this complication to a
minimum, you have to make the number of notions zero or one, which are
two numbers that can be raised to any power without disturbing this
concept. Since you cannot achieve much with zero notions, it is my
belief that you should base systems on a single notion.

This paper describes the command language and some utilities on the UNIX
time-sharing system `(137)`, which runs on DEC PDP-11/45 computers.
Examples are given that show how the single notion of I/O streaming and
interconnection of utility programs are used to build complex programs
from simple utilities.

Virtually every construction profession (building, hardware, etc) except
that of software production relies on pre-fabricated building blocks. We
have long since passed the stage when total rebuilding was feasible, yet
this is still the way in which many systems are developed.

This paper, as well as describing the syntax and semantics of the UNIX
command language, attempts to show a method of decomposition of programs
and reconstruction using basic building blocks. This method is not
perfect, or even right, but has to be a step in generating programs of
the next level of complexity.


THE SHELL
---------

Most users of UNIX, when they log on, find themselves talking to a
program called the Shell. The Shell's job is to execute programs
specified by the user. The simplest of the requests has the form:

<pre>
<em>command arg<sub>1</sub> arg<sub>2</sub> ... arg<sub>n</sub></em>
</pre>

This instructs the Shell to execute the named command and make the
specified arguments available to that command as character strings.
Since users may write their own commands and give them arbitrary names,
the command name is first assumed to be a user-supplied name. In this
way, the existence of an obscure system command does not restrict the
user's vocabulary.

Every command executed has two files pre-opened for it. One can be read
from (the standard input) and other can be written to (the standard
output). Normally, a program's standard input is the user's console
keyboard, and the standard output is the console printer.Thus, most
commands use the standard I/O files for interactive communication with
the user.

The Shell has the ability to redirect a command's standard I/O files
without the command's knowledge. For example, the syntax:

<pre>
sh &lt;<em>filename</em>
</pre>

instructs the Shell to run the `sh` command with the standard input
switched to the file. This happens to be the name of the Shell itself.
Thus this invokes a second Shell to read and execute the commands
specified in the file.

The obvious extension of this syntax:

<pre>
ls &gt;output
</pre>

instructs the Shell to run the `ls` command with standard output
redirected to a file called `output`. This file will be created by the
Shell if it does not already exist. If it exists, it will be truncated.
The `ls` (abbreviation of list) command writes an alphabetical list of
the names of all of the files in the current working directory. It is
totally unaware of the redirection of the standard output that has
occurred.

Another instance of output redirection

<pre>
date &gt;&gt;output
</pre>

instructs the Shell to put the standard output from the `date` command
on the end of the output file. This is done by not truncating the
`output` file if it is found to exist. If it does not exist, it is still
created. In this case, the current date is appended to the file
containing the directory list.

In UNIX, all I/O devices have names identical in syntax to regular
files. This gives added power to the Shell's redirection abilities. For
example,

<pre>
sh &lt;crd &gt;lpr
</pre>

starts a Shell reading from the card reader and writing to the line
printer. This can naively be called 'batch processing'.

Commands, together with their I/O redirections, may appear on a single
line if they are separated by a semi-colon (`;`) or an ampersand (`&`).
If a command is followed by a semi-colon, its execution must complete
before the rest of the line is interpreted. The previous examples of
`ls` and `date` could have been executed by:

<pre>
ls &gt;output;  date &gt;&gt;output
</pre>

With an ampersand instead of a semi-colon, there is a difference. The
command preceding the ampersand is set in asynchronous execution. As in
a previous example, the command

<pre>
sh &lt;crd &gt;lpr&
</pre>

will start a 'batch' job stream without tying up a console.

The most exotic feature of the Shell is its ability to connect the
standard output of one command directly to the standard input of
another. Again, neither program is aware that such things are going on.
In the example

<pre>
ls | pr
</pre>

the command `ls` will produce a directory listing. The command `pr` will
paginate this listing with dated headings. The `pr` command, of course,
is just reading its standard input and is unaware that it is paginating
anything but a stream of characters. This can be done less elegantly by
the commands

<pre>
ls &gt;junk
pr &lt;junk
</pre>

followed by removal of the temporary file. Extending this idea, the command

<pre>
ls | pr | lps
</pre>

will cause a paginated directory listing to be delivered to the line
printer spooler. The `lps` spooler copies its standard input to files
that will eventually be copied to the line printer.

A final example of the Shell's syntax is its use of the parentheses.
Anything in matched parentheses is executed as a single command by a new
instance of the Shell.

Thus,

<pre>
(ls;  date) &gt;output
</pre>

will spawn another Shell to execute the commands inside the parentheses.
This is identical to a previous example using `>>`. Another example is

<pre>
(sleep 3600;  echo DONE)&
</pre>

In this case, the `sleep` command will suspend execution for a number of
seconds given in its argument. The `echo` command will write its literal
argument onto the standard output. The combined effect is that after an
hour the word DONE will be printed on the console. Of course, in the
meantime, the console is free to execute other commands.

The Shell, and the commands it executes, form an expression language,
the elements of which are quite grandiose operations. Since these
operations can be user-supplied, it is easily extensible.


THE SHELL AS A COMMAND
----------------------

The Shell is just another command and by redirecting its standard input,
it is possible to execute commands from files. This section describes
utility programs that are mainly used inside such command files.

First, and trivially,

<pre>
: argument
</pre>

does absolutely nothing. The command `:` is the much talked about 'null'
program; it ignores its arguments and simply exits. One of its uses is
to annotate Shell sequences.

The command

<pre>
goto <em>argument</em>
</pre>

'rewinds' its standard input. It then reads the standard input looking
for the syntax of a `:` command with an argument matching its own. It
leaves the standard input positioned after the `:` command. When control
is returned to the Shell, execution continues where the standard input
was positioned. (This implies certain things about file positioning and
open file sharing that will not be discussed here.)

For example, if the text

<pre>
: loop
<em>command</em>
sleep 120
goto loop
</pre>

is placed in a file, then the command

<pre>
sh &gt;file
</pre>

will execute whatever is specified by *`command`* about every two
minutes.

The next example is

<pre>
if <em>expression command</em>
</pre>

The `if` command evaluates an expression consisting of one or more of
its arguments. If the expression is true, it executes the rest of its
arguments as a command. The expression may concern such things as the
existence of files, comparison of strings, and the successful execution
of commands.

The Shell, as a command, may be passed arguments. If it is, these
arguments may be substituted into the standard input like macro
arguments. The Shell also allows for its whole list of arguments to be
shifted. This makes it possible to repeat the same set of commands for
each argument of the list.

The Shell also has the ability to construct argument lists from pattern
matches on all the file names in a directory. In this way, it is
possible, for example, to remove all files ending in 'x' or to print all
files having three-character names, and similar operations.

All this gives the Shell and the commands that it executes the
appearance of a programming language.


EXAMPLES
--------

This section consists of further examples of Shell facilities followed
by explanations of the commands used.


### Spoken output

Consider the example

<pre>
date | snobol spdate  | speak
</pre>

The date command produces output of the form:

<pre>
Wed Jan 8 21:26:39 EST 1975
</pre>

The second command runs the SNOBOL program `spdate`, which produces the
following output:

<pre>
today is wednesday january eighth.
at the tone the time will be
nine thirty six p.m.
beeeeeeeeep.
</pre>

The last part of the example is the program `speak` `(138)`, which is a
remarkable program that heuristically converts arbitrary English words
into phoneme output for a commercially available voice synthesizer. So
this example causes the computer to pronounce the time of date over a
loudspeaker in the computer room.


### Desk calculator operations

A more practical use of the speak program is

<pre>
dc | numb | speak
</pre>

`dc` is an arbitrary precision desk calculator. Since its output
consists completely of numbers, the `numb` program converts digits into
spoken numbers. The use of `speak` here is obvious; the effect is a desk
calculator for the blind.

The input

<pre>
2 32 ^
</pre>

(reverse Polish meaning 2 to the 32nd power) causes `dc` to send

<pre>
4294967296
</pre>

to `numb`, which sends

<pre>
four billion,
two hundred ninety four million,
nine hundred sixty seven thousand,
two hundred ninety six.
</pre>

to `speak`, which pronounces it.


### Encryption

In the example

<pre>
crypt password &lt;in | <em>program</em> | crypt password &gt;out
</pre>

an arbitrary program is flanked by an encryption/decryption program. The
program receives clear input from the decryption of the input file. The
program's clear output is then encrypted. This scheme allows the program
to manipulate clear text maintained in encrypted form without the risk
of first generating a clear file.


### Selective directory listings

A selective listing of a user's files could be obtained by

<pre>
(ls; tp t) | sort | uniq u
</pre>

The `ls` program produces a list of the files in the current directory.
The program `tp` maintains users' personal archive tapes. With the `t`
option, `tp` produces a list of the files contained on a tape. The
parentheses and semicolon concatenate the outputs of the two lists,
which are sorted and delivered to `uniq`, which compares adjacent lines
of text for equality. Conceptually, `uniq` splits a single copy of all
duplicated lines onto a `d` steam and all other lines (unique lines) onto
a `u` stream. The `u` option selects the `u` stream to be output. Thus the
example will print all files that are found only on tape *or* only in
the current directory. All file names found both on tape *and* in the
directory are suppressed. The variants

<pre>
((ls;  tp t) | sort | uniq u); tp t) | sort | uniq d
((ls;  tp t) | sort | uniq u); ls) | sort | uniq d
</pre>

will further select the output. The first example will print file names
that are on tape but not in the directory. The second will print those
in the directory but not on tape.


### Text formatting

Mathematical typesetting can be performed by

<pre>
eqn &gt;text | troff
</pre>

The `troff` program accepts text and formatting directives for the
purpose of photo-typesetting a document, and `eqn` `(139)` is a language
pre-processor that translates equation descriptions into formatting
instructions. Some examples of input and output are shown in Figure 1.

<pre>
<em>Equation description</em>                                           <em>Output</em>

                                                               x<sup>2</sup>  y<sup>2</sup>
{x sup 2} over {a sup 2} + {y sup 2} over {b sup 2} = 1        - + - = 1
                                                               a<sup>2</sup>  b<sup>2</sup>

e sup {x sup {2 alpha} + y sup {2 beta}}                       e<sup>x<sup>2&alpha;</sup></sup> + y<sup>2&beta;</sup>

<em>Figure 1: Mathematical typesetting</em>
</pre>

There are many more examples of language pre-processors. The desk
calculator described above has an algebraic language front end. The
FORTRAN compiler has a facade implementing modern control structure
`(140)`.


### Curve plotting

The sequence

<pre>
calc | plot
</pre>

is a simple example of a calculation that produces as output a set of
paried numbers. The `plot` program accepts numbers, and produces a
scaled labelled plot. If `calc` did not produce the numbers in monotonic
order, the variant

<pre>
calc | sort | plot
</pre>

would fix that. Also if smoothing is necessary, the futher amendment

<pre>
calc | sort | spline | plot
</pre>

includes a spline curve fitting algorithm.


### Inter-user messages

Finally, the sequence

<pre>
cc prog | mail cperson
</pre>

shows the unexpected and extemporaneous way two programs were used. In
this example `cc` is the compiler for the C language, which is the axis
around which all of UNIX resolves. UNIX itself is written in C, as are
the Shell, C, and about 70% of the system commands.

The `mail` command is used to send messages to a user's 'mailbox' file.
The user is informed of the existence of this 'mailbox' when he first logs
on.

What happened was that the person who maintains C accidentally installed
a bad compiler late at night. When the morning crowd arrived, virtually
all work was at a standstill. This example shows how one user sent
twelve pages of undeserved C diagnostics to the culprit by way of a
subtle complaint about the bug.


RETROSPECT
----------

It is probably obvious that many of the examples of large computing
tasks have the form:

<pre>
<em>source</em> | <em>filter</em> | <em>sink</em>
</pre>

Here the *`source`* program has something to say; `ls` and `date` are
UNIX source programs. (Often the source is replaced by a file, which
states it contents.) This is often processed by zero or more *`filter`*
programs from where it is delivered to a *`sink`*. The sink is usually
defaulted to the console, but can be an output file or a program
resembling a pseudo-device. `Sort` and `uniq` are filters and `speak`
and `plot` are pseudo-device sinks.

When new UNIX software is required, the prospective program can usually
be recognized as belonging to one of these categories. As a result of
this classification and a realization of a program's relationship to
existing programs, much more general software is produced. Programs do
not contain large number of features. These features are split out into
separate filter programs. For example, our language processors do not
produce listings or cross references; these are unrelated tasks.

The whole notion encourages a cleaner understanding of the anatomy of
data processing. Programs are smaller, cleaner, easier to document, and
easier to maintain.


SERMONETTE
----------

Many familiar computing 'concepts' are missing from UNIX. Files have no
records. There are no access methods. User programs contain no system
buffers. There are no file types. These concepts fill a much-needed gap.
I sincerely hope that when future systems are designed by manufacturers
the value of some of these ingrained notions is reexamined. Like the
politician and his 'common man', manufacturers have their 'average
user'.
